# Tumor_ML_project
Using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, matPlotLib and scikit-learn to use Support Vector Machine Classification Machine Learning to predict whether a cancer tumor will be classified as benign or malignant based on kaggle tumor dataset below. The first part of the project was to using exploratory data analysis and visualizations with Seaborn and matPlotLib to identify what features/characteristics of data could be used. The second part of the project was applying machine learning model from scikit-learn, doing train and test split, evaluating with Mean absolute error and mean squared error, conducting a grid search for more optimal model, and than comparing resulting
